# Restaurant-Food-Ordering-System
The Restaurant Food Ordering System in C++ is designed to facilitate the process of ordering food from various restaurants. The system allows users to select their preferred restaurant and view the menu passively displayed. The available food items, along with their respective prices, are presented to the user for effortless decision-making. Once the user chooses the desired food items and quantities, the selected items are silently added to the order. The system efficiently calculates the total bill without any user intervention. The Restaurant Food Ordering System offers a seamless and convenient way for customers to place their orders and enjoy a hassle-free dining experience.
